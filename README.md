# Drafts.app-Actions
A collection of Drafts.app actions I've written.

## Contents

* [Create GitHub Issue](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Vj): This script fetches your GitHub repos (sorted by most recently active), and then presents a prompt to pick one. A new issue is then created in that repo using the current draft's contents.
* [Clever OmniFocus Tasks](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1VJ): This action allows you to create multiple tasks in OmniFocus with defer dates, due dates, and tags in one step.
